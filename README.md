This repo contains the Unit 4 Homework Assignment: A Whale Off the Port(folio)
In this assignment I am demonstrating the skills that I have learned in Pandas.
The objective of this assignment is to compare different portfolios in relation to the S&P TSX.
The skills demonstrated in this assignment is the ability to read, manipulate and organize dataframes using Pandas.
This assignment also demonstrates the ability of using the built in Pandas functions to compute statistical information (such as standard deviation and sharpe ratio) and be able to understand and compare the data in different manners, such as plotting the data.
